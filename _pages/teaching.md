# Teaching

I am currently teaching International Agricultural Trade (450/596) and Intermediate Microeconomics (303) at the Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University. Previously, I have taught Data Analysis with R for Agricultural Economists (University of Göttingen), Micro- and Resource Economics (University of Göttingen), International Trade (Kiel University) and Microeconomics (Kiel University).

## Current Teaching

<div class="jumbotron">
### International Agricultural Trade

<div class="jumbotron">
### Intermediate Microeconomics
**AGEC 303, Purdue University**

This course develops advanced microeconomic models of consumer and producer choice. All theory is derived from mathematical first principles and relies heavily on applications of calculus, with motivating examples and case studies drawn from topics in agricultural and resource economics.
